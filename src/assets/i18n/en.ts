    // Faq Payout Percent and Annual Return Questions - English
    "faq-title": "F.A.Q.",
    "faq-header": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq-sub-header": "Something unclear? You might find the answer below. If not, feel free to contact us on our socials.",
    "rewards-metric-questions": "Rewards Metric Questions",
	"faq-question-1": "What does payout percent mean?",
	"faq-answer-1": "Payout percent is the percent of a supernodes revenue that they are giving away to voters.",
	"faq-question-2": "What does annual rate of return (ARR) mean?",
	"faq-answer-2": "Annual rate of return is how much ELA would be gained per year as a percent. An example would be if we vote with 100 ELA for a supernode with an Annual Return of 0.15% for an entire year, we would use the following calculation; (100 * 1.0015 = 100.15). Now if we vote for 36 nodes with an average Annual Return of 0.15% for an entire year, we would end up with 105.4 ELA or a total ARR of 5.4%.",
	"faq-question-3": "Is the payout percent and annual rate of return an estimate based upon what supernodes say they are paying?",
	"faq-answer-3": "Nope, it's real data mined from wallet transactions that calculates what they are actually paying.",
	"faq-question-4": "Why have both payout percent and annual return, what's the difference?",
	"faq-answer-4": "Payout percent is useful for seeing how much of a supernodes revenue they are paying out, but it doesnâ€™t scale with votes (top 24 ranks earn more), and since votes effect the nodes revenue we need annual return to show voters what kind of actual amount they can expect.",
	"faq-question-5": "Are all payouts like lotteries and alliance bonuses factored into the Percents and Returns?",
	"faq-answer-5": "No, these bonuses are not factored into the percents or annual aeturn information.",
	"faq-question-6": "How accurate is the payout percent and annual return information?",
	"faq-answer-6": "Generally, the payout percent information should be accurate to within a 1-2% under normal circumstance. The annual return information should be accurate down to 0.04%.",
	"faq-question-7": "How up to date is the payout percent and annual return information?",
	"faq-answer-7": "Our information is gathered and calculated multiple times per day. However it can take up to 1 month to get new transactions, an example would be a Supernode that pays out monthly. As a general rule, our data will be an average from the past two weeks.",
	"faq-question-8": "What happens if a supernode suddenly stops paying?",
	"faq-answer-8": "ELAnodes will give that supernode one month to make the proper payment before reporting that it is paying out 0%.",
	"faq-question-9": "What happens if a supernode changes their payout amounts?",
	"faq-answer-9": "Since this is live data collection, any flucuation in their payout will be properly reported, however since we often take many transactions over a period of time it may take a couple of weeks before their percentages settle to its new proper amount.",
	"faq-question-10": "Why are so many nodes showing 0% as their payout percent and annual return information?",
	"faq-answer-10": "You may have guessed this one, they are not paying out anything.",
	"faq-question-11": "Why are some nodes showing 'No data' or 'Error' as their payout percent and annual return information?",
	"faq-answer-11": "This is a result of us not having enough transaction data to perform the necessary calculations. It may take some time to update depending on the nodes payout system.",

	// Faq Supernode Operator Questions - English
    "supernode-operator-questions": "Supernode Operator Questions",
	"faq-question-20": "I just registered a supernode and want to add my social links and supernode details to ELAnodes.",
	"faq-answer-20": "You can use the request form at the bottom of ELAnodes.com to provide us with all of your information, or contact us directly through telegram.",
	"faq-question-21": "I just registered a supernode and started paying voters, how long till my information shows up on ELAnodes?",
	"faq-answer-21": "Our system requires at least two valid transactions to benchmark your rewards with respect to time. If you use ELAbank, this can take a while because they have a minimum payout value threshold and our voting wallet balances are small.",
	"faq-question-22": "I run a supernode and I don't think my payout percent and annual return information is accurate.",
	"faq-answer-22": "If you run a supernode and you think our data is wrong, please let us know via telegram or e-mail. We will look into it to make sure our data is correct.", //The word 'Telegram' is a url link to https://t.me/starfish_supernode, The word 'E-mail' is a url link to mailto:contact@starfish-supernode.tech
